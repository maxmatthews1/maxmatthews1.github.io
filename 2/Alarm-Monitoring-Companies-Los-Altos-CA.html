<h3>Best Home Security Monitoring System in California</h3>
<p>We downloaded each camera's app to an iPhone 7, an iPad, and a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie, when possible. The cameras invested weeks securing our front door, notifying us to good friends, member of the family, shipment people, and even the milkman. Once we got a good enough look at those friendly faces, we tilted the whole collection outward for another 2 weeks to see what kind of results we would get when the cameras faced your house across the street, which is around 50 feet away.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
