<p>The majority of the cameras we checked need an Air Conditioner outlet, so positioning is definitely an element. A few designs use batteries, making placement more versatile, but this requires other compromises, which we highlight in the Competition section. Wi-Fi protection also affects where you position a camera: If you want to put a camera in an area that doesn't get a good Wi-Fi signal, think about upgrading your router or including an extender or repeater. (For a look at our networking choices, see our guides to The Best Wi-Fi Router (for The Majority Of People)" and The Very Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good rule of thumb that if your mobile phone or laptop gets decent Wi-Fi reception in the location you wish to mount the camera, you likely will not have a problem.</p>
