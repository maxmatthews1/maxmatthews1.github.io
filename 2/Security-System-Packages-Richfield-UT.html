Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a private security personnel. Several cities also need a license to even operate a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are developed to limit the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Lots of towns will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>
