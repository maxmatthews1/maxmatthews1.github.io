The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image.

<p>Though the Arlo Ultra (see below) technically has all the very same smarts and more detailed 4K resolution, the Arlo Pro 3 still won our T3 Awards 2020 award for Best Smart Security , because its image quality is still exceptional, and it's slightly much better worth - though its price is still its achilles' heel. Still, what you get for the cash is all the usual Arlo characteristics in terms of the strong construct quality, excellent camera video, tons of smart features and a polished app.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
