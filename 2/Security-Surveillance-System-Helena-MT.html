<p>Our alarm systems may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge a violation. As soon as a zone has actually been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
