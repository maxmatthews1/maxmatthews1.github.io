<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>

Rather, you turn signals on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a regular self-monitored system can do like set off a camera to record or activate the siren.
