<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
