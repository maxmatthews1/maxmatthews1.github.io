<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is absolutely something to be taken into account. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal.
