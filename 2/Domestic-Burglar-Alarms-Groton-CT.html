<p>A little more costly than our winning wise alarm, this system was practically as easy to install and, throughout screening, the loud, clear siren fasted to sound if one of the sensors had actually been set off. We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and only informs you when motion is developed by something with the same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no incorrect informs). However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have key fobs and additional sensors, too.</p>
