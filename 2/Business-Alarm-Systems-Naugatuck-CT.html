<h3>Home Alarm System Cost in Naugatuck CT</h3>
<p>Unlike standard alarm systems, which have a control board (usually situated in the entrance hall) that is used to deactivate the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensing units have been triggered, clever alarms are managed from a smart device app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and alerts you if any of the sensing units have been activated, instead of getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and possibly irritating your neighbours).
