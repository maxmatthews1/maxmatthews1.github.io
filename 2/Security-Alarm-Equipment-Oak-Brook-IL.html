<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall.
