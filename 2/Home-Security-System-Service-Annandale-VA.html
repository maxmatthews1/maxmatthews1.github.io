An unmonitored system leaves all the work up to you. That means you need to be on day, night and call, during work and holiday time, and all set to determine whether authorities, fire departments, or other emergency situation services need to be dispatched. Then, you need to make that call yourself. It's a huge distinction, and an expertly monitored system is essentially more secure than a self-monitored or unmonitored one.</p>
