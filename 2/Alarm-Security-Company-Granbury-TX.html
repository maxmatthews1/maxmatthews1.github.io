<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later produced to deal with the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly chosen words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally focus and still be able to see things clearly.</p>
