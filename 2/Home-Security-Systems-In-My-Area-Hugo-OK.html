We should again respond to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates.

Operators might also start calling a list of telephone number supplied by the consumer to contact somebody to go examine the safeguarded properties. Some zones may trigger a call to the local heating oil company to go check on the system, or a call to the owner with details of which space may be getting flooded. Some alarm are connected to video surveillance systems so that existing video of the intrusion location can be immediately shown on a remote monitor, not to point out taped.</p>
