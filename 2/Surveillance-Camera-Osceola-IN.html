<p>Research studies show surveillance cameras decrease criminal offense. HD CCTV systems work with traditional analog CCTV cameras. If you purchased cameras prior to 2010 or if you have coax cable (look at the cable behind the TV that goes to the cable television box) in your existing security system that implies you have traditional analog CCTV security cameras. You can update your existing analog CCTV security system without sacrificing your coax facilities if you buy HD-CCTV security system.

Central station operators might be instructed to call emergency services right away, or to first call the safeguarded properties or property manager to try to figure out if the alarm is genuine. Operators could likewise start calling a list of phone numbers supplied by the consumer to call someone to go look at the secured properties. Some zones might trigger a call to the local heating oil company to go look at the system, or a call to the owner with information of which space might be getting flooded.

<p>Analog security cameras send lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can manage such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security package, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community should take on a share of the cost. If alarm use led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer break-ins throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute considerably to authorities ability to collar burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers subsidize authorities reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a pricey and inefficient  approach to theft decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>

<p>We required guards for our yearly Coats for the Cold event to safeguard the line tent and structure, keep order in the wee hours of the early morning and to start the heating system at 5am. The first guard arrived early so he could look at the entire location and talk with me about my issues. He was professional, considerate and very reassuring. The 2nd guard arrived in the middle of the night and took over. When I showed up in the early morning to get the occasion started, he was also professional, courteous and comforting. We were really happy with your service and I will recommend that we get in touch with your company next year for this occasion. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. I didn't stress once after leaving our property in your hands.</p>
