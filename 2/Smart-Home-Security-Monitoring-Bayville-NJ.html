<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never matches the manufacturer's statistics since this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest perpetrator for brief battery life without a doubt.

<p>SimpliSafe offer legitimate only for those who acquire a new SimpliSafe system that consists of a minimum of one (1) Base Station, one (1) Keypad and one (1) Extra Sensing Unit. Not legitimate with any other offers. Offer not valid on SimpliSafe Original system or Reconditioned systems. SimpliSafe Regards To Sale and all other applicable SimpliSafe Terms apply.
