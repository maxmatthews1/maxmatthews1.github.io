<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
