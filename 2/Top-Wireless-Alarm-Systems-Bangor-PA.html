The systems motion detectors and door sensing units work so good because the one I purchased before this one, that was allegedly trustworthy, does not Work as good as this system does.</p>
<p>In place of the landline connection which conventional home security systems require, wireless security systems communicate through radio frequency and make use of a built-in cellular connection. TP-Link is known for its solid, no-nonsense, no-frills home security package, and the manufacturer is constantly worth a look if you want some reputable hardware at an affordable price. That's definitely true of the Kasa Area KC100, a home security camera created for the inside.</p>

Of course, you may want to think of purchasing a security camera or two to accompany your system, but going with the five-piece Ring Alarm set plus a Video Doorbell 2 (around $400 overall) is a little bit more expensive than Frontpoint's most basic plan for $320 (or $255 with the 20% marketing offer), which does not include a camera.</p>
