<p>Twenty-five years ago, basic and business interactions were mostly concurrent. To accomplish practically anything, somebody live" needed to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, particularly when dealing with national and worldwide business. The very same is true for security and video surveillance.

Everything is synchronized and everything occurs in genuine time.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
