<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>

The app was also painfully slow when we accessed live streams and taped clips, in addition to when we made changes in the settings.</p>
