<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
