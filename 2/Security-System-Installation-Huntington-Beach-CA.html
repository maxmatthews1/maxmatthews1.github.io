<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
