<p>What's not to like about the Arlo Ultra? This camera takes cutting edge to new heights and comes with a ton of key functions we haven't seen in a single video camera (or at all) previously. SimpliSafe produces and sells its own devices. The quality of this equipment appears satisfactory to most users, though it can't be utilized with a different monitoring service like third-party equipment might.
