<p>When looking at a regular camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the distinction in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to deal with information after the fact, which means that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution offers some advantages, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are very large and take up a great deal of recording storage space. So much, in fact, that they need about 4 times the hard drive area of 1080p to tape-record the very same length of video footage.
