<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, vandalism, and scams. Suggestion: Frequently keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We should again react to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one way of eliminating expensive incorrect alarms.
