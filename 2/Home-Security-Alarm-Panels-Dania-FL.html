If you wish to keep an eye on what's taking place in your house when you're not there, but you do not wish to purchase a full-fledged home security system, a Wi-Fi-connected camera deserves a look. These are the best indoor home security cameras in our testing. Aside from excellent equipment, Frontpoint uses 100% wireless equipment using cellular innovation.

Nest Aware memberships are priced per camera, and if you want to pull out of paying for storage entirely, Nest only gives you up to three hours worth of recordings. Wired security systems are linked by hard-wired cable televisions and require access to power outlets, making them harder to place and install. Wireless systems, on the other hand, use a WiFi connection, fast to set up, and can be put anywhere inside (or outside) your home.</p>
