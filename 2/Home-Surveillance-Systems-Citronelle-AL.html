If you wish to view a large location, you must think about a camera with an extremely wide field of vision. The capability to mechanically pan and tilt the camera is a great asset also.</p>

<p>The box-style camera is what the majority of people consider when they think security camera." The most commonly-used security cameras, box-style cameras enable great flexibility in lens customization. While they are utilized most often, box-style cameras are not the most appealing.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
