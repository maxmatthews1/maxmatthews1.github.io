<p>Unlike standard alarm systems, which have a control panel (usually situated in the entrance hall) that is utilized to equip and disarm the alarm and alert you if any sensing units have been activated, smart alarms are controlled from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you have actually currently left home, and notifies you if any of the sensors have been triggered, instead of getting home to discover your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially frustrating your neighbours). However, clever alarms do require a hub that enables the different components to wirelessly link. However for a lot of smart alarms this hub can be positioned throughout your home.</p>

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later produced to deal with the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly picked words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA essentially uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
