Obviously, the obvious disadvantage to a wired security system is that the initial install can be expensive. If the system was not installed throughout the homebuilding procedure, setting one up may require drilling holes into walls, running new wires, covering drywall and gaining access to hard spots that are sealed off in basements or attics.

The typical length of a home security agreement is 36 months or 3 years. On the greater end, some agreements could cover up to 60 months or 5 years. We would recommend considering a DIY home security system instead if you want to avoid having to sign an agreement.</p>
