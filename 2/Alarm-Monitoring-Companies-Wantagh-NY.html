<p>Another crucial topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video image; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The very same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much image details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>
