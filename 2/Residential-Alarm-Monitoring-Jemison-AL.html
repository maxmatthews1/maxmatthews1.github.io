When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a regular camera image. The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to fix information after the truth, which means that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some advantages, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and use up a lot of taping storage space. So much, in fact, that they require about 4 times the disk drive area of 1080p to record the same length of video footage. Be prepared to spend more money if extended video storage is very important.</p>
