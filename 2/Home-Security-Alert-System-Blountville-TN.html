<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
