A separate network using classification 5 wiring can be used if bandwidth is an issue. Either way, video info is tape-recorded on a server, which means video information can be found on website or in a remote area. After screening, we sent out each of our top choices, as well as the Wyze Web cam v2, to Costs McKinley, head of information security at The New york city Times (Wirecutter's parent company), for hack screening.
