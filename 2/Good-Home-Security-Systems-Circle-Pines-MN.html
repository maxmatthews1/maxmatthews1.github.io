<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
