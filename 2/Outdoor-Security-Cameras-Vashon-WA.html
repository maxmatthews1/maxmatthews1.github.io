<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped casing that the camera beings in. Whilst these are reasonably discreet CCTV cameras in look, this doesn't stop them from hindering crooks. This is because the dome casing makes it truly hard for people to see which instructions the camera is pointing. This produces an air of unpredictability for possible burglars or vandals approaching from all instructions. If those situations seem like your life, Vivint and Link Interactive use some versatility on monitoring agreement length if you buy equipment up front.

<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts whenever you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
