It isn't extremely wise. Wireless devices communicate more firmly and faster to other gadgets on the system and to the monitoring center (if you pick monitoring).</p>

ADT engineers test the company's cameras, entrance contacts, high-decibel alarms, and smoke detector under tough conditions-including extreme heat and cold, as well as scenarios where there might be radio interference.
