If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space quickly.

However, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute considerably to authorities ability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by police and entire communities (all taxpayers fund authorities response to alarmed properties) a inefficient and pricey method to burglary reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
