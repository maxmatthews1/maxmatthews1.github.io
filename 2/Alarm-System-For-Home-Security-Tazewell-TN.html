<h2>Security Cameras, CCTV Systems, Alarms Tazewell</h2>
<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even set off false alarms. False alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they happen regularly enough.

<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to make every effort to make a camera with the most tough setup known to man.

Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic sound wave to the camera to send the WiFi information. (You must play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, canines wail, felines squeal, children cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds. It doesn't work. And it never works.</p>

Let that sink in for a minute ... these companies do not even utilize the kind of cameras they are offering to the general public, and there is a good reason that.</p>
