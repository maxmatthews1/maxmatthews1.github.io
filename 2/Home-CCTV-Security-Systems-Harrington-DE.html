The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black.
