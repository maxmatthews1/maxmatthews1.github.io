<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we checked, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Subscription. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our testing. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to recognize already-identified faces.
