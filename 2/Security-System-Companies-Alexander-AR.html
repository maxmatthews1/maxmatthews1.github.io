Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>

<p>Nurse calling systems typically consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's washroom. If a patient is having problem, he can push the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station. This is a basic switch that is normally open or generally closed. Most of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and signals, sensing units, gain access to control, and so on. My mind conceived an approach of not only providing the client with the patient-monitoring system but incorporating it into their old-fashioned nurse call station system.</p>
