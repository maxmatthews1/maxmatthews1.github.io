<p>The Nest Webcam IQ features an integrated Google Assistant and integrates effortlessly with the rest of the Nest home automation suite. It stands apart with an 8x digital zoom function and big 130 ° field of view. Video clarity is likewise great, and this camera can shoot in (compressed) 4K. That implies you get a clearer look at everything that's happening, and zooming is something that's really useful.

<p>You can pick from SimpliSafe's original award-winning system or their latest line of equipment. Both systems use impressive, reputable home security. With the newer system, you will pay more, but that higher price includes a system that is smaller sized, quicker, and stronger. At half the size of the original system, the small sensing units are practically unnoticeable. The new system works 5 times quicker, and the alarm is 50% louder to frighten trespassers.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
