<h3>Wireless Alarm Monitoring in Waterford MI</h3>

Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, clever lock, etc.), I want to make sure that they all quickly communicate with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>

<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is saved on a remote server operated by the producer, instead of at your house) is the standard these days, but some cameras keep recordings locally on a microSD card or a connected hard disk. Onboard storage is nice, but it won't be of much help if someone takes the camera. Hackers can gain control of wireless camera systems.
