<p>Our burglar alarms may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize a violation.

As soon as the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
