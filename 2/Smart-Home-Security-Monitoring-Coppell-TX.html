<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
