<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to sophisticated smart home aficionados or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I checked, consisting of smart things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.
