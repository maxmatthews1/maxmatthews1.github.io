<p>To gauge response times for the monitoring company, we set off each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensors. However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a private security personnel. Numerous cities also need a permit to even own and operate a home security system. Guidelines such as these are designed to limit the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on false alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>
