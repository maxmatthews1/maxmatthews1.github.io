<p>Nurse calling systems typically consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the client's toilet. He can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station if a patient is having difficulty. This is an easy switch that is generally open or usually closed. Most of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and signals, sensing units, access control, and so on. My mind conceptualized an approach of not just supplying the client with the patient-monitoring system but incorporating it into their old-fashioned nurse call station system.</p>

Once a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. When the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the alarm system's keypad and switching off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
