It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to store footage in your area on an SD card.

However the company does use a Complete Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is discovered.
