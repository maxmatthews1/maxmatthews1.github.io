<p>Discover how to create, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and reduce crime. The Ring Floodlight Camera integrates two necessary gadgets in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera finds movement, it switches on its 2 effective LED beams along with its sharp 1080p camera, and begins recording. The Floodlight Cam also has a loud speaker, so you can talk with whoever's in front of the camera, and hear their reactions.

Like indoor security cameras, they can be integrated as part of a home security system or used separately to up the security level around your home.</p>

You can schedule notifies with "Home", "Away", and "Sleep" modes in the app. Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they record; whatever within their focus capability is caught.
