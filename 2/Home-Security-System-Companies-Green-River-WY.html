Nearly all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and many have integrated sensing units that identify motion and sound and will send push and e-mail notifications when those sensing units are set off. You can typically fine-tune the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to family pet activity or passing cars and trucks if the camera is near a window, and you can develop a schedule that turns the sensors on and off throughout particular hours of the day.</p>

<p>When mounting cameras inside your house isn't a choice, you might want to explore hidden cameras, which are cameras that are small and discreet, in some cases suited everyday things such as clocks, smoke detectors, and magnets. If you need to record a crucial conference in a public location, a personal hidden camera constructed into a watch or pen may be a good alternative.
