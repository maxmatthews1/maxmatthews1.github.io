However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have essential fobs and extra sensors, too.</p>
