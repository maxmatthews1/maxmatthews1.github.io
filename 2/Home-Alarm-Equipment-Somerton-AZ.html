<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal because the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
