<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later on produced to deal with the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily chosen words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
