<p>ADT authorized provider SafeStreets charges a $99 (or more) installation cost, but the brand name doesn't otherwise charge up front for a system it states is worth $1,300. The equipment's all provided by third parties, so what you receive may be from a various manufacturer than the equipment your next-door neighbor got. Why's that? ADT uses an independent supplier model including third-party dealerships. The dealers identify which equipment to utilize. Expenses for systems differ. Bigger systems that use full-house protection with professional monitoring are the most expensive alternatives. Smaller, self-monitored systems are the most budget friendly choice.</p>
