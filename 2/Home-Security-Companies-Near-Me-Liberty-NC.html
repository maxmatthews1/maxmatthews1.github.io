<p>Pelco provides video surveillance cameras and video management options for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping others, hotels, and centers. Some individuals might say that we must not have surveillance cameras in public places. They declare that they get into personal privacy. The argument here, nevertheless, is why be out in public if you want privacy? Surveillance cameras are suggested to keep you and other residential or commercial property safe, not to stalk you.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR.
