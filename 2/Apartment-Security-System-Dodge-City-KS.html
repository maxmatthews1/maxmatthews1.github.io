Functions 1080p HD camera with night vision. One thing we actually liked was the customer-friendly policies-- like the lifetime guarantee on items and the rate-lock guarantee for life. This reveals us that the company actually cares about its users. Other than possibly Frontpoint or ADT, we normally don't see this with most companies.</p>
<p>The Nest Web cam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the same subscription design and exact same app as the initial Nest Web cam Outdoor, but it adds in more-detailed person detection, a brighter image, an automated close-up tracking feature (which follows a person around the seeing location), much better audio, a more powerful mount, and a wider operating temperature level range (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit). It's likewise more tamper-proof than any of our other picks, but that added security makes for a more difficult installation procedure, and it costs almost two times the price of the Nest Web Cam Outdoor.</p>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
