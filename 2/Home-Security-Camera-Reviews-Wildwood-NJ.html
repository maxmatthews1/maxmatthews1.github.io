This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, generally by means of 110VAC power.</p>

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
