Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute considerably to police ability to collar intruders makes the underwriting of alarm response by authorities and whole communities (all taxpayers support police response to alarmed homes) a expensive and inefficient  technique to robbery reduction throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
