This is also known as the logical choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity prevention strategy, which argues that opportunities to offend can be reduced by modifying a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of an offender being apprehended, increasing the effort to dedicate the crime, reducing rewards from crime commission, and lowering justifications that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).
