<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

The models we have actually evaluated up until now either record very brief clips, leave huge spaces in between those short clips, or require charging on a regular basis.</p>
