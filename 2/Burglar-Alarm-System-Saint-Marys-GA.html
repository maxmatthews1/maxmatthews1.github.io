<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for one of our top spots. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape-record as much as 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were often missing, despite appearing in the app's activity timeline. With standard smart home devices like automatic door locks, you can stay in bed and inspect that you locked your doors.
