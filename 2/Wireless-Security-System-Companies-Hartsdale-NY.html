<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of complimentary cloud storage (with more offered for a monthly fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will enable the camera to correctly spot motion and not get stuck taping on a loop.
