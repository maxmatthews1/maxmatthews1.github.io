The normal reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying a chance for the destructive assaulter to tape these codes and use numerous cracking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can release a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based upon the "design" security crucial caught throughout the network healing.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

<p>Because the glass housing does not get in the way, they aren't quite as vandal-proof as dome cameras, but they offset it in capabilities. As well as being excellent for re-positioning on the fly, they are better for low-light and infrared because the glass real estate doesn't hinder the lens.
