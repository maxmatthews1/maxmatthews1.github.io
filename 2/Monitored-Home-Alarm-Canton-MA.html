<p>3 big benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their impermanence, mobility and expandability. Occupants, unlike property owners, typically avoid making permanent changes to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entrances with detachable adhesive.
