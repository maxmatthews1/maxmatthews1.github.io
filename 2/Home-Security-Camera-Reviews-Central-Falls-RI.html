<p>Discover how to develop, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and reduce criminal activity. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>

Nevertheless, to save that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink does not give you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations.
