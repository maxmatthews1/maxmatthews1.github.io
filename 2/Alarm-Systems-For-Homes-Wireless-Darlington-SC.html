<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the producer's stats since this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest culprit for short battery life by far.
