<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on produced to resolve the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly picked words) makes pre-shared essential WPA essentially uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

The systems have adjustable electronic devices to permit installers to alter the level of sensitivity of the alarm detectors to the suit specific environmental conditions. The tuning of the system is typically accomplished during commissioning of the detection devices.</p>
