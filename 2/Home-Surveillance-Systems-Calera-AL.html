<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network should be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is absolutely something to be considered. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is an excellent choice for long variety scenarios where poles and trees are not present.</p>
