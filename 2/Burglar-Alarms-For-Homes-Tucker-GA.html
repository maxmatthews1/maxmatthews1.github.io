<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
