<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment in this manner to make customers stick with them longer, since changing monitoring companies indicates hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for consumers.
