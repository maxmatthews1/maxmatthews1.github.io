<p>Another important subject to go over is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend just how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video photo; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much picture information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some difficult effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
