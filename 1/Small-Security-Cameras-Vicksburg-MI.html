<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, accommodating innovative smart home connoisseurs or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I checked, including clever things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system. But the Secure is expensive, additional sensing units are costly, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include fire alarms or camera backups-- is likewise pricey if you do not dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>Unmonitored systems will not provide the same level of protection for your home, either. Even if your system links to your smart device, there are times when you might not be in a position to do anything about an alarm going off, like when you're on an airplane, in a crucial meeting, or in an area without phone reception.
