Throughout screening, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we enjoy that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adapted to account for animals, too. The alarm is just one of two we tested that consists of an external siren, and we're amazed that it also includes a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, even more discouraging anybody from attempting to break in to your home. We evaluated Somfy's more expensive system, which included a wifi security camera, but more budget-friendly sets are likewise available.
