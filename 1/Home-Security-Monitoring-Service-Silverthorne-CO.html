Considering that this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to by hand stop alerts (and recording, since it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with 2 Hive test units disconnecting eight times over two months. Scout is very simple to utilize, especially if you're a fan of mobile phones.

Onboard storage is good, but it won't be of much help if someone takes the camera. Hackers can get control of wireless camera systems.
