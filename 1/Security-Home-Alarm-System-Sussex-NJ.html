After checking out the discuss this page I went to Armorax's site to see what they provided; they've partnered with another security company and their starter bundle I believe starts at $0 down.

Then, you need to make that call yourself. It's a huge distinction, and a professionally monitored system is fundamentally more secure than a self-monitored or unmonitored one.</p>
<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>

Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

<p>We still recommend SimpliSafe overall due to the fact that it has a broader range of equipment and better cameras.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
