<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times most likely to be robbed. With years of experience monitoring and setting up video and audio security systems for Seattle homes and services, we've developed terrific relationships with both local police forces and their clients. Also, do not forget that your wireless network security can be sometimes weak, and prone to exploits.

If contract strategies don't interest you, think about Blue by ADT, which offers Do It Yourself installation and self-monitoring.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
