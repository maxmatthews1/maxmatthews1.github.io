<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
