<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
