<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>

<p>A lot of home security systems involve DIY installation of surveillance equipment, so I make certain that that's a simple procedure. I observe the process and make sure that the rate isn't too high if a home security company just uses expert installation.
