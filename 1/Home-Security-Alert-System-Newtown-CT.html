As such, even if somebody get into your home in complete darkness, you'll still have the ability to see them in your smartphone app. The only issue here is that the recorded video footage will be black and white and a little dark so you might not have the ability to see information clearly.</p>

<h3>Best Rated Home Security Systems in Connecticut</h3>
<p>We downloaded each camera's app to an iPhone 7, an iPad, and a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie, when possible. The cameras spent weeks protecting our front door, alerting us to good friends, family members, shipment people, and even the milkman. When we got a good enough look at those friendly faces, we tilted the entire collection outside for another two weeks to see what type of results we would get when the cameras faced the house across the street, which is approximately 50 feet away.</p>
<p>There's a couple of other cool features in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving things if it identifies an intruder; a helpful intercom function that permits the device to serve as a smart doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hello doorbell ); and, because Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.
