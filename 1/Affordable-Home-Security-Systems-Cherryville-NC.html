<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or house is the duty of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you plan to save and the length of time you plan to keep documented video. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video footage is going to eat up storage space quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video once you reach the system's capability, but if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>
<p>Though the majority of our attention these days is concentrated on the shift to IP video technology, it is essential to note that analog CCTV security cameras can still be highly effective for lots of surveillance applications, especially those on a budget.

However that does not indicate you can't utilize analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Utilizing IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to utilize your existing analog cameras while migrating into the world of digital surveillance.</p>
