<h3>Wireless Surveillance Camera System Cedar City UT 84721</h3>

The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of free cloud storage (with more available for a month-to-month fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will permit the camera to correctly detect motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That also saves battery life, but it might leave you with tape-recording gaps during crucial security occasions.
