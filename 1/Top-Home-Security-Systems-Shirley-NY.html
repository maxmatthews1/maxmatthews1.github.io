<p>Nurse calling systems generally include emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's toilet. If a patient is having trouble, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is a simple switch that is usually open or usually closed. Most of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and notifies, sensing units, access control, and so on. My mind conceived a method of not just supplying the client with the patient-monitoring system but integrating it into their old nurse call station system.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe's 3 crucial strengths are its ease of usage, the number and range of pre-designed security packages they use, and their robust trial and warranty durations.
