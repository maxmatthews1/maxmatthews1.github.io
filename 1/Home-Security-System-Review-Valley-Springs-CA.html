<p>So, while alarm systems may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a total security package, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community must shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less thefts throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to authorities ability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and whole communities (all taxpayers support police action to alarmed properties) a inefficient and pricey method to break-in decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
