The response hinges on a number of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you intend to save and how long you plan to keep recorded video.

<h3>Good Home Security Systems in Hawaii</h3>

Here is what this means, by way of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
