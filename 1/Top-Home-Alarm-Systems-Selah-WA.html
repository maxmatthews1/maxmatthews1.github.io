<p>The genuine reason cameras are generally deployed is to lower much pettier criminal activities. But it has not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been thoroughly deployed in public locations, sociologists studying the problem have actually discovered that they have actually not reduced crime. "As soon as the criminal offense and offence figures were adjusted to take account of the general downward trend in offences and crimes," criminologists found in one study, "decreases were noted in specific classifications but there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had decreased criminal activity overall in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office likewise found that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of crime (as had a 2002 research study, likewise for the British federal government).</p>
