Battery-powered Wi-Fi cameras are the most convenient to install since you can put them practically anywhere (as long as they can link to your router) without having to snake a power cable into your home to plug into an outlet.

<p>Keypad: A smart device app is a should for use when you're far from home, but you should not have to fumble with your phone when you're going and coming. A keypad can sit by the front door, making it simple to arm and disarm the system. Including Ring Alarm makes sense if you currently own a Ring video doorbell and desire to broaden your home security protection. When you include other Ring products to Call Alarm it ends up being a more robust security system that can provide live video streaming, two-way communication, and clever lighting.

<p>Flood lights are typically used in conjunction with motion detectors. When sensing units identify movement, the lights illuminate the surrounding location, which will allow you to see who is on your property and will possibly frighten trespassers. Better outdoor lighting also means a clearer video for any outside cameras you have. When selecting flood lights, consider the brightness and distance the light shines. Flood lights can prevent vandals or scare them away, but as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your peace of mind than for home protection.</p>
