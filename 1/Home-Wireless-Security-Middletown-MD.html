We love that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just signals you when motion is developed by something with the same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no incorrect alerts). However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensors have been activated.

Care needs to be taken to make sure the surrounding soil uses good drainage in order to prevent problem alarms.</p>

Both the initial Residence system and the House Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, however the Iota is the only model we evaluated that also deals with HomeKit.
