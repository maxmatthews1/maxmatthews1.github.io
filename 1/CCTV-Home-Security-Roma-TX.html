<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a satisfaction to use also (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you want to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a knowing curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's great, though. If you do not already have an Arlo camera or more in location, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all link to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can indicate there are variety problems.</p>
