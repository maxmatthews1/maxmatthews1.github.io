<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical given that the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level.
