<p>Twenty-five years back, general and business communications were mostly synchronous. To accomplish practically anything, someone live" needed to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, especially when dealing with nationwide and worldwide business. The exact same applies for security and video surveillance. Usually, CCTV is most efficient as an active system, with a guard monitoring the corridors and somebody else, someplace, enjoying video surveillance displays for assistance. Everything is synchronized and whatever occurs in real time.</p>
