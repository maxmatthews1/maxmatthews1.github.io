<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical because the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
