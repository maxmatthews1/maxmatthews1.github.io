Now, most security systems include a multitude of parts, such as a base station, security camera, entry, motion, and glass break sensing units, a keypad, and essential fobs, among other components.

<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
