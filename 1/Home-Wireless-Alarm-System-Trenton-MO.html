<p>Sensors allow cameras to begin and stop tape-recording based on time or motion detection. The one time where lag does become a bit of an issue is in between finding and taping motion. Because the Pro 2 does not do constant video recording, it takes a 2nd for the camera to in fact turn on when it discovers motion. They could get past the camera before it had time to tape-record them if a nefarious lawbreaker was fast enough.

Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
