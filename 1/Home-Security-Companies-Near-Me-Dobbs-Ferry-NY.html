<p>Pelco offers video surveillance cameras and video management services for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping centers, others, and hotels. Some people might state that we must not have surveillance cameras in public places. They declare that they invade personal privacy. The argument here, however, is why be out in public if you want privacy? Surveillance cameras are implied to keep you and other property safe, not to stalk you. When a crime has been captured on film, cameras are there not to attack an individual's privacy but to protect the public by hindering criminal activity and by supplying material evidence.</p>

<h2>Wireless Video Surveillance & Wireless Camera Systems Dobbs Ferry</h2>
<p>In industrial plants, CCTV equipment may be used to observe parts of a process from a central control room, for instance when the environment is not ideal for people. CCTV systems might operate continuously or just as needed to monitor a particular event. A more advanced type of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), supplies recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and efficiency alternatives and additional functions (such as motion detection and email alerts). More just recently, decentralized IP cameras, maybe equipped with megapixel sensing units, support recording straight to network-attached storage devices, or internal flash for entirely stand-alone operation.</p>
<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is certainly something to be considered. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would cause a disturbance in the signal. A wireless bridge is a great choice for long range scenarios where trees and poles are not present.</p>
