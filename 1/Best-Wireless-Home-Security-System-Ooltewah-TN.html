The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
