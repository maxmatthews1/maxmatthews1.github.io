<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
