It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you've identified (after a learning duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>Cross-zoning is a technique that does not need a new keypad. Using multiple sensors to monitor activity in one area, software application analyses input from all the sources. For example, if a motion detector trips in one area, the signal is recorded and the central-station monitor notifies the client. A 2nd alarm signal-- received in a surrounding zone within a brief time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor needs to request a dispatch instantly. This integrates in increased protection and a fail safe need to a door blow open or a bird rattle an exterior window.</p>
