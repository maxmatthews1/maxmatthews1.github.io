Instead, you can filter occasion notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription).

When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
