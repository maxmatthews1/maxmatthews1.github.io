It likewise does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid membership prepare for extra cloud storage.
