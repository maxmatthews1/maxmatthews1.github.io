<p>Our alarm systems might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge an offense. When a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
