Many insurer offer discount rates on insurance premiums to consumers with operable alarm. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous authorities departments use a number of "totally free" incorrect alarms before imposing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to react is considerable right from the start. The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance companies call into question the appropriateness of the present trend in U.S. policing of allowing three or 4 totally free false alarms per fiscal year, because they offer no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
