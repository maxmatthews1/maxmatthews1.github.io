<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a kind of situational criminal activity prevention developed to avoid both personal and home crime and can be used in place of, or in addition to, cops.

It is believed that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will decrease criminal activity and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other nearby areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
