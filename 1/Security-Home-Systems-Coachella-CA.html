<p>Given that the glass real estate doesn't obstruct, they aren't quite as vandal-proof as dome cameras, however they make up for it in abilities. Along with being terrific for re-positioning on the fly, they are much better for infrared and low-light because the glass housing does not impede the lens. With some, it's difficult to inform at a glance where they have actually been intended, so they can give a panoptic impression as a deterrent, regardless of their real field of vision. Installing a video surveillance system with a few of these is a fantastic choice for a number of different setups.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
