<p>Another crucial subject to discuss is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image.

When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some challenging consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
