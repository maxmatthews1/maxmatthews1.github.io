<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, since it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network.
