<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
