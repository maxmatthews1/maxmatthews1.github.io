<p>Among the very best elements of this alarm is that it has a very sophisticated motion sensing unit.

We've seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting arrangement (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>
