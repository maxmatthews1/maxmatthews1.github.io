<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security specialists looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can record as much as 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were typically missing, regardless of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With standard clever home devices like automatic door locks, you can stay in bed and examine that you locked your doors.
