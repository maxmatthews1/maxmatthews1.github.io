<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
