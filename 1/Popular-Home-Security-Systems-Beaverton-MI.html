Throughout screening, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we like that the sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adjusted to account for pets, too. The alarm system is just one of two we evaluated that consists of an external siren, and we're amazed that it also features a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, further discouraging anybody from attempting to break in to your home.
