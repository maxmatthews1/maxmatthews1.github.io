<p>Discover how to design, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and minimize crime. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image.

If  police are contacted for a false alarm, house owners might need to pay a fine for dispatching cops unnecessarily.
