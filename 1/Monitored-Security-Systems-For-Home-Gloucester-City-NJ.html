<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than protecting what you treasure most ... your family and home. The backbone of a home security system is the base station. This system is what communicates with all of the security sensing units and smart-home components in your house. Many link to a home router, but if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular support, placement is more flexible.

<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
