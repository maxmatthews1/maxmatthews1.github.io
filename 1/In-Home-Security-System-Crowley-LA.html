<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle however profound modifications to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being watched by the authorities - or conscious they may be seen at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually mentioned, "understanding that you are being enjoyed by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You do not wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals may learn to be cautious about the books and regulars they check out in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers. They may likewise put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang hookers, members or drug addicts." Undoubtedly, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that individuals deemed to be "out of time and location" with the environments were subjected to prolonged surveillance.</p>
