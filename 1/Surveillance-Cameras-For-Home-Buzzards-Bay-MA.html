<p>Pelco uses video surveillance cameras and video management solutions for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping others, centers, and hotels. IP cameras work by using an IP (IP means internet protocol) network, often the exact same information network the rest of a company utilizes.

<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we might point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually installed on the patio by a licensed electrician (who takes place to be my husband).

<p>You'll need a camera with onboard video storage or cloud recording capabilities if you want to playback your home's outdoor activity.
