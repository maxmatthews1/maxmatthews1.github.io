It's lengthy, and that's an advantage if your preferred mounting place isn't near an outlet.

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the requirement for further circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera separately, usually through 110VAC power.</p>

Wireless security systems are more nimble and integratable, however low signal strength and poor connectivity are still common complaints.

<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate in between 1080p and 4K resolution when looking at a typical camera image.
