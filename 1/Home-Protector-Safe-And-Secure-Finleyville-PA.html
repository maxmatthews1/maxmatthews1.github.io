<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature.

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical since the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
