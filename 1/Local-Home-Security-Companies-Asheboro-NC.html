Regrettably I acquired 4 cameras that look just like these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Boy was I wrong!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is truly great. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
