<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends prospective wrongdoers are less most likely to commit criminal offense if they think they are being seen or have a higher threat of being nabbed. This is also known as the logical option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance technique, which argues that opportunities to anger can be reduced by altering a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of a culprit being captured, increasing the effort to commit the crime, reducing rewards from crime commission, and lowering provocations that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This indicates that the culprit needs to be aware of the added surveillance for it to achieve its preferred result.</p>
