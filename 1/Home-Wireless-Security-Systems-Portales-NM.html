<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
