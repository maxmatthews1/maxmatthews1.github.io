<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
