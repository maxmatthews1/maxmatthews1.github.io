<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound modifications to the character of our public areas. When citizens are being seen by the authorities - or aware they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has explained, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You don't want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "individuals might find out to be careful about the regulars and books they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, drug addicts or hookers."
