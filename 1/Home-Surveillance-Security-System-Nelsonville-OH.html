<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
