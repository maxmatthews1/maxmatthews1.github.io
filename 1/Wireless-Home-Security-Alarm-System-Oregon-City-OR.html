However, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are large and take up a great deal of tape-recording storage space. So much, in truth, that they require about four times the hard disk space of 1080p to tape the same length of video footage. Be prepared to spend more cash if extended video storage is important.</p>
