<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>

<p>But for everybody who enjoys ADT, it seems like there's someone who's had an awful experience.

The night mode produced extremely crisp images, but they didn't look as bright as the Logitech Circle 2's. However, utilizing the SimpliSafe mobile app requires a paid monitoring strategy.
