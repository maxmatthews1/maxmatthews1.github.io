<p>Nurse calling systems normally consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's restroom. If a patient is having problem, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station. This is an easy switch that is normally open or usually closed.

Wireless control board, sensing units and other parts can easily be established at various residential or commercial properties later, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new components too.
