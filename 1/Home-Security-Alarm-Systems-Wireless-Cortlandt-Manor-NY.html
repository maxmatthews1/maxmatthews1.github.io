<p>Thanks to current improvements in innovation, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you've decided to install an alarm system, you must think about the following advantages of wireless technology. The $260 Basics plan consists of the base station, a keypad, four entry sensing units, one motion sensor, a lawn sign, and two window decals. For $15 per month, you can include around-the-clock professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can interact with the monitoring service without a landline. The $25-per-month Interactive plan includes control via iOS and Android smart device apps, push and e-mail alerts, and 30-day event-footage storage for unlimited cameras, consisting of the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is offered individually.
