<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against fraud, theft, and vandalism. Idea: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must once again react to the alarm; each response is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of costly false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a certain level, you can make it automatically shut off the heating systems. If the motion sensing units are triggered, you can instantly make the clever lights turn on to frighten potential intruders.</p>
<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All items give off infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy emitted by an object is called its heat signature. In basic, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it emits. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensing unit that is capable of discovering tiny differences in temperature. The device collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and creates an electronic image based on details about the temperature level distinctions. Since objects are seldom exactly the exact same temperature level as other objects around them, a thermal camera can find them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>

<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
