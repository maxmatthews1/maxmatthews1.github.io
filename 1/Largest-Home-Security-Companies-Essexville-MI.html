<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our testing-- during the day and during the night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would periodically downgrade the image quality based on available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day.
