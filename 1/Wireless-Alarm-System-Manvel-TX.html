<p>This nifty clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. Throughout testing, we discovered it was easy to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly activating when movement was detected. We like that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll require a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get expensive. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be installed on the ceiling (it only keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.
