<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally referred to as shock sensors, are various because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most intense frequencies created are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
