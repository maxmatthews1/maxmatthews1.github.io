<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to strive to make a camera with the most tough setup known to male. Here's how it plays out: First you have to put and download the app in your e-mail address.

(You should play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pet dogs shout, felines scream, children cry.

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not particularly revolutionary, so we're truly recommending the security cameras here.

So select what will be the much better deal for you. If you know you'll sit tight for at least three years, go with the agreement and gain those savings. But if you may update to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
