<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is certainly something to be considered. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disturbance in the signal.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>

<p>Professional installation was practically the only way to put in a home security system 15 years ago. Innovation has come such a long method that Do It Yourself systems can offer the exact same level of security (and often more) with a self set up system. Further, there can be additional benefits to a Do It Yourself system because they're generally a lot easier to transfer to another home if you move. For someone trying to find a more complex setup like home automation, or someone that wants a trained specialist to make the recommendation for the setup, professional installation is a terrific option. We've found that many people that were worried about self installing a home security system really wound up discovering the process really easy. There are companies out there like Frontpoint that are known to be especially valuable in this phase.</p>
