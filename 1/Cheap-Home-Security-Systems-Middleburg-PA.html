<p>Unlike conventional burglar alarms, which have a control panel (typically located in the entryway hall) that is utilized to disarm the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensors have actually been activated, clever alarms are controlled from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you have actually currently left home, and notifies you if any of the sensing units have been set off, rather than getting home to find your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and possibly annoying your neighbours). However, clever alarms do require a hub that allows the different components to wirelessly link. But for the majority of smart alarms this hub can be placed throughout your home.</p>
