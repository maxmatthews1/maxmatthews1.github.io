The offers of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance companies bring into question the suitability of the existing trend in U.S. policing of permitting 3 or 4 free incorrect alarms per calendar year, since they offer no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
<p>We like that the Argus 2 comes with a color night vision option, however the white and black variation can actually be clearer and give you higher-quality video.
