I observe the process and make sure that the cost isn't too high if a home security company just uses expert installation. Expert home security installation tends to skew upwards of $100, but it's actually your choice whether it deserves its hefty price tag.

<p>Linking analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you require additional cables. DVR systems are hard to scale up due to the fact that when every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you need to acquire an entirely new DVR prior to adding another camera to the system.
