In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
