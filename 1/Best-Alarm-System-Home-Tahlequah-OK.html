<h2>CCTV Video Surveillance Tahlequah</h2>
<p>The implicit justification for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the risk of terrorist attacks. But suicide assaulters are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can guarantee - and the expenditure of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up around 20 percent of that country's criminal justice spending plan - far exceeds the minimal benefits that the system may supply in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>Are independently owned, ran surveillance cameras to be dealt with the exact same way as public cameras? We also need to draw great lines about 'Who actually is seeing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge bro? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one! The camera might legally do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They might peer inside of windows with the complete protection of the law on their side.

We've experienced a few technical issues while long-term testing the Abode Iota, and so will continue to check and upgrade appropriately. We no longer recommend it.</p>
